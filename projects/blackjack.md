Black Jack is card game that is usally played in casinos, but what if you cannot go to casino and want to still have the same thrill of playing Black Jack? 

This project allows you to play the game of Black Jack by applying the rules of B lack Jack and prompts the user what they would like to do, this is a single player game that randomly assigns the user a card from the deck.

This project was for an assignment in EE 160 where we had to code a game in C language.This was coded by a gorup of 4 people including me. We tried our best to break up the work evenly. 

Thisd project was th first group coding project I had done and form this one experience I learned a lot. I learned that it's hard to assign rach person equally without planning out an algorithm first.
