## Coding Standards
Having a coding standard is essential when creating a code that you plan on going back in. Coding standards are execatly what the name says, it is a standard that you can impliment on your code, rules and guidlines. These rules and guilines can be implimented on your files and show up as errors for you to fix. Of course you can finish a coding assignment for school that is unorganized and not have to look back but once you start to become a software engineer you will start writing software that you plan on making use out of. When you write a code this is unorganized and come back it will take a create a great ammount of time to understand the code if it is unorganized. By implimenting a coding standard on your code files it will make it easier for you when you have to go back in to the code oon a later date. This is not only beneficaial to you but when you work with a team of people this can make it easier for them to understand your code as well. <img class="img-fluid" src="../img/standards.jpg">

## Development Environments
Being able to to code and knowing how to use frameworks is apart of the job of the job when creating a software. Just like how a painter needs to have good quality materials in order to create a good painting, software engineers also need to have a good devleopmental environment to use. If a painter has cheap paint that takes a long time to dry it can take them a long time to create a painting and the results will not come out the same. When having a good developmental environment it can cut the time it takes to create code down by a lot. An idle that I have been enjoying is Intellij, I first began to use it for web deleveoping but I started to use it for different types of codes too, like object oriented codes. Having a coding standard can be helpful in making your code orginized but what Intellji does it that it fixes the coding standard errors for you with just a single click. I have only used a handful of different idles but Intellij has cut down the time it takes for me to fix errors by a lot. Being able to fix errors efficiently has allowed me to focus more on developing a more quality code. Just like how a painter having good quality paint allows them to add more details on the painting if they get to save time on the paint drying. <img class="img-fluid" src="../img/intel.jpg">

## Agile Project Management
Having coding standards and a good developmental environment to ipliemnt said coding tandards will save you and your team a great deal of time but when working on a project having proper management is important for being efficent at completing the project. You will find yourself deadlines once you become a software engineering and you will find yourself working wih groups of people so being able to be efficent at creating projects is what agile project management is. Some key parts of agile project maagement is being transparent with one another, having shared ownership, and being consistent with improvements.   <img class="img-fluid" src="../img/agile.jpg">
