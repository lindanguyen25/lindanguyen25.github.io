## Why I Chose Computer Science
I always saw programers in the movies typing really quickly with the green font and black background and thought they looked really cool but I had never considered it for myself. When I had to choose a major for college I choose engineering, specifically electrical engineering. I had always been good at math and critical thinking, I also always ended up in the robotics team in elementary school and middle school and so I took engineering related classes in high school and enjoyed it. I ended up not enjoying engineering in college as it was a completely different experience from highschool. As I was deciding what other majors I would like to do in my sophmore year of college I was taking EE160 or coding for engineers. Through this course I was able to see what it was like to code and throughly enjoyed it as we did multiple fun projects through this course. I decided to pursure a computer science degree after that EE160 course and have enjoyed it a lot.

## Right Now
Currently I know how to code in C, Java, and I am currently learning JavaScript. I have very basic skills and currently make a lot of syntax mistakes. I learned that it is not always better to continue searching for errors and that starting from the beginning with a program can actually be better than to not give up. I know I have a lot to learn and I am only getting started so I am excited to see how much my coding skills will gorw. 

## Goals
I would like to know more coding languages and through my college courses I have been able to learn three so far. I would like to learn C++ and python. I would also like to learn more about SQL. I'm not too confident in my knowledge of coding but I hope through my algorithms course I am able to learn more efficient coding as I tend to break down the problems and create overly complicated codes. I also hope that through athletic programming I gain better critical thinking skills.
