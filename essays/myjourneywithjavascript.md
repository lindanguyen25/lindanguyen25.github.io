## The Start of Understanding Javascript

Javascript is the first front-end language I have worked with. So far the most powerful detail that I have noticed about Javascript that differs it from other languages I am familiar with (C and Java) is you can use functions as though they are a string.
I’ve only been working with Javascript for about a week so I’m not too sure what my opinion of Javascript is but so far I can see that being able to use function like they are a string can help make codes more efficient instead of having to write a code 
that has to work around not being able to implement functions similarly to other elements. 

## Athletic Software Engineering
Something interesting about my journey in learning Javascript is the introduction of athletic software engineering. When I first heard of that term I pondered what it could possibly be as one would usually associate athletics with physical endurance and 
software engineering as mentally enduring, two very different types of endurance. However athletic software engineering is actually a very efficient and effective way to study coding as it pushes the coder to use critical thinking. This is done by applying 
time constraints very similar to how sports players have a time constraint during games thus allowing coders to have to critically think. 

## WODs/ Work Out of The Day

WODs (Work out of the day) is a part of athletic software engineering, just like how sports players have practice before games WODs allow you to practice before the time constraint coding.. I have done a lot of labs and group projects in other computer 
science courses but this is the first time I have heard of a type of course style that really pushes students to do an assignment daily. At first I thought the workload would be too much if we are required to do an assignment for this one course daily but 
I came to realize that the workload was the same but it was just broken up in a way where instead of one hard assignment that we would do once a week, WODs are made so could do it daily while having the same workload as other computer science courses.  
Practice WODs are helpful because I could study all the concepts of Javascript but all the memorizing would not be useful if I do not know how to actually implement them and the only way to learn how to properly use them is by practicing, having different 
practice WODs and being able to different ways to have the same result with different codes is helpful to learn how to code in Javascript. Having practice WOD’s nearly every day also ensures I am getting consistent practice which will help retain my skills better in a longer time period.
