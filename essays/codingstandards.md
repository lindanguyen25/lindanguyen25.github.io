## What is a Coding Standard?
Coding standards is exactly what the it says.  It is the standards that coding has, it is the style, the indentation, the methods, and many more of a program. It is basically a set of guidlines that has to be followed. When I first heard that it had to be used in the software engineering course my reaction was not positive. I felt like everyone had a different style that they used when they code, some like to leave the closed bracket on the same line as the last line or others may like to leave the closing bracket one a line of its own. Whether a programmer choose one or the other was up to them because it's their preference whether or not they found one or the other esier to identify for them. I felt like coding standards took that away from the programmer. On top of having less of a choice of the style our code was I felt like coding standards were just an extra step we had to take in order to have the file compile correctly. I thought it would take up too much time to follow coding standards ontop of already having to fix syntax errors. That was until I tried using coding standards on Intellij. 


## Getting Used to Coding Standards
When I first startedd using Intellij and coding standards I noticed a little light bulb on the left side of a line that would either be yellow for warning or red for error. I thought this was just another way for the idle to show that there was an error in a perticular line so I ignored the little light bulb and focused on where the error was in said particular line. In order for me to follow the coding standard I had to go back into very place there was a red squiggly line that indicated an error which took a substantial amount of time. There was a instance where I checked all of my indentations and spacingd but could not find error so I decided to see exactly what the red squiggly line was by clicking on the red light bulb. I had used to the light bulb previously to see what the error was but I had not clicked on the error itself before, when I did I got a pleasent surprise. By clicking on the error on the light bulb the idle had automatically fixed the error for me. 

## My Honest Opinion on Coding Standard
In this very case where the idle pretty much does the coding standard fix for me I can see how it can be beneficial to following a coding standard. It helped me orginaze through my functions better and break up parts of a program better to help me identify issues that may not be causing an error but an issue that is causing my program to not have the output I want. However if I were to use a idle that did not easily fix coding standards in a click of a button the way Intellij does I wouldn't nessary be in favor of coding standards. Especially in cases where there is a time constraint, having to go back and manually fix every error can take up a large amount of time. 

## Lesson Learned 
I learned that it's important to fully understand an idles tools as it is powerful knowoledge when it comes to coding. It was hard for me to fully set up Intellij so I was careful not to touch any of the settings as I did not want to change something that I may not know how to reverse. However I think making those mistakes causes you to fully understand the idle you are working with better.
