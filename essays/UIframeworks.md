## Frameworks
Frameworks can be hard to learn. Having to memorize all shortcuts and style makes it feel like you are learning a new codsing language. It can take a lot of time to understand it and memorize what to do. The first framework I learned how to use ws Bootstrap5. It is used in html and can make it so you do not need a style sheet. Of course you may not be able to 100% get rid of the style sheet but after using Bootstrap5 my style sheet only had a couple lines. One big part of Bootstrap5 is the container. It was really hard top get used to learning how to put row and column classes in the right places. It was a big jump having just learned how to use html in one week to having to jump to Bootstrap5. I think it was important to start using frameworks right after learning html though because when I was learning bootstrap it was hard for me to get the syntax right so I automatically wanted to just start using css more which in turn made it take longer for me to code a website as boostrap does cut down a code by a lot. 


## Benefits
Like I mentioned earlier once you get used to bootstrap it can save you a lot of time since the code is significantly shorter which in turn can mean it is less likley for you to make syntax mistakes. Having container makes the style sheet a lot shorter since container does a lot of the display work. Since you do not have to code so much of the display on the style sheet it gives you more room to play with more characterstics that will stand out like chaging the color or fonts. 

## Cons
Though bootstrap makes the style sheet a lot shorter I noticed that when using bootstrap I had to use div a lot more. Even with indentation it took me a moment to get used to it. Using a lot of div also made it harder to get the syntax right. I probably see this as a con since I'm still not used to boostrap and html but as of now I find it difficult to tell apart all of the different div. 

## Conclusion
I'm still learning how to use boostrap since I'm getting used to using copntainer but I can see how it can be beneficial to learn in the long run. For front end coding separting the display from the style sheet can mean that you can be creative in the style sheet.
